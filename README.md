Hello there! This is a tip calculator. It asks the user how much his bill was, how good the service was and how many people want to share the cost of the meal.

After all the data provided, the program calculates how much money each person should tip. 

The page is made with:
1) HTML, 
2) CSS,
3) and JS

The design of the program is pretty simple, but I wanted to concentrate myself on the JS part, only using CSS to center the calculator and to trying out the linear gradient background color.
The page is also fully responsive and can be read comfortably from any screen.

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
